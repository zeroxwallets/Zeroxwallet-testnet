# ZeroxWallet ‚Äì Milestone 1 Submission

Objective
The goal of Milestone 1 was to successfully deploy and demonstrate a functional non-custodial wallet on the Hedera Testnet, showcasing core features such as account integration, transactions, and smart contract deployment.

Achievements

‚úÖ Live Wallet Deployment on Hedera Testnet
ZeroxWallet is now operational on the Hedera Testnet with a working user interface.

‚úÖ Core Wallet Functions

Real-time HBAR balance check using Hedera Mirror Node APIs.

Send & Receive HBAR securely through Hedera Account IDs.

Transaction History integrated within the wallet UI.

QR Code generation for seamless fund receiving.


‚úÖ Authentication & Security
Wallet creation and storage are handled via Firebase authentication, ensuring secure storage of account credentials during testing.

‚úÖ Smart Contract Deployment
A sample smart contract was deployed and verified on the Hedera EVM using Remix, proving integration with Hedera‚Äôs contract ecosystem.

‚úÖ Frontend + Backend Integration

Frontend built with Next.js (UI for wallet actions).

Backend APIs integrated with Firebase Admin SDK for account handling.
